            Indian sages and wise men have called knowledge (Vidya) as the means of man’s liberation. Man has desired freedom from fear, hunger, vices, bad tendencies, bad conduct, weakness, poverty and inferiority, disease, grief etc. since time immemorial. The above Mahavakya of Shri Vishnu Puran gives the message that man should strive to get freedom from all his troubles through knowledge. Knowledge is the fruit of sacrifice and penance, hence the attainment of knowledge is always hard work.
